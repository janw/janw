### Hi there 👋

My name is Jan, \
I do things on the internet.

🌍 There is a great deal of things beyond coding that are important to me. I've become politically active in recent months, and more and more worried about the political situation—specifically in the US with major implications on the freedom and independence of open source software and what it represents culturally.

🛑 Thus I made the decision to **no longer maintain my open source projects on GitHub, and instead move all active development to [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org)**, a European non-profit, community-led Git hosting provider for free and open source projects.
